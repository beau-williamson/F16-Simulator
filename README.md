# F16-Simulator
F16 Simulator Hardware/Software Project

This project is a team of hardware and software being created by many users of the F16 simulator software.  The primary goal is to create individual sections for each Panel (e.g. HUD Panel, Fuel Panel, etc.) that makes up an F16 Simulator for hobbyist.  Each section will contain the Fusion 360 and KiCad files necessary for people to use to build their home F16 simulator to many different levels of realism. Some can be quite limited in reality and others can approach cockpit panels that are very close to real identified panels.  This can be desided by the person using the mechanical and PCB files to make each Panel.

Each F16 Simulator "Panel" consist of all the files to make the Light Plate (LP) with home CNC machines, matching Back Plates (BP) to which the Light Plate bolts to and also Connector Plates (CP) to which the wiring connectors attach.  All of these are complete "Panels" of Fusion 360 projects with LP, BP and CP plus some extra special parts.

In between the LP and BP there will be KiCad PCB designs that allow the hobbiest to order the matching PCB's that mount between the LP and the BP.  The PCB will have several options with how to build it with either LED's or real Lamps like used in many F16 Light Plates.

The end result is a design that can use simple and inexpensive "F16 Panels" for people building their F16 Simulator for their home as well as nearly realistic-like "F16 Panels" that use a more realistic build using higher quality parts.  The choice to do this is up to the user.

In summary, users can achieve various levels of detail construction for their simulator whose design permits a variety of application of the design.  More details on using these Fusion 360 KiCad files (under construction) will show the user how to apply these files and make their F16 Simulator for hobby flying.
